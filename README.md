# 50miniprojects
50miniprojects from https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days?tab=readme-ov-file 
Built by myself while learning html css and javascript

I got inspo from each project and then built it as much as possible without looking at the code. 
Doing these to practice my coding skills.
